# About
Use these configs as a starting point to improve performance.<br>
Adjust bindings, sensitivity, refresh rate, and resolution to your preference.<br> 
Settings are subjective, so these configs are not definitive.<br> 
High-end GPUs owners can afford to experiment with higher graphics settings.<br>

# Nvidia Users & Reflex
Unfortunately, most people focus only on framerate, which is why Nvidia Reflex is highlighted here.<br>
Remember, while FPS is important, system latency matters more.

Enabled/On
- No loss in framerate
- Lower system latency
- Most configs are set to this

Enabled/On + Boost
- Slight framerate loss
- Further reduction in system latency
- Recommended setting
